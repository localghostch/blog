**Category :** Web
**Description :** SSRF ME TO GET FLAG.
http://139.180.128.86/
**Hint :** hint for [SSRF Me]: flag is in ./flag.txt


## Write-up
As suggested by title and description, we had to make a ssrf attack to get the flag.
The home page of the website returned the server's source code:

                    tmpfile.write(resp)
                    tmpfile.close()

```

I analysed the code starting by the entry points (REST Services). We could do two actions via this services: 

1. Sign a request calling /geneSign
2. Execute an action calling /De1ta



### /geneSign analysis:

This part of the source code was pretty simple. We could see that: 
1. We could only sign a 'scan' action 
2. There was no filtering on the 'param' field therefore we could pass anything 
3. Our input was directly used to build the request signature

### /De1ta analysis: 

This part of the code contained the vulnerability. We could see that: 
1. We could perform two different actions on the server "scan" and "read" 
2. "scan" allowed us to write data in a temporary file via scan() method.
3. scan() execute  ```urllib.urlopen(param).read()[:50]``` which contained 'param' field (we have control on it)
4. To execute a command, we had to provide its signature (compared to one computed server-side) 
5. Actions were executed on a temp file named ./result.txt 

From here we could deduce the attack: Write the content of ./flag.txt in result.txt (scan action) and then read result.txt to get the flag (read action). It looked easy but there were two problems:

- There was a waf() function which prevented us to use ```gopher or url starting by file:``` 
- We needed to sign our 'read' action but /geneSign only worked for 'scan' 

### Exploit 

#### Write the content of ./flag.txt

 According to ```CVE-2019-9948``` (https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2019-9948/) we could use local_file: scheme to bypass the waf()function.In fact the function prevented only 'file:' scheme
 Therefore it was pretty easy to write the flag in result.txt.
1. Get the signature for our request: GET  /geneSign?param=local_file:flag.txt
2. Call url to write the flag: /De1ta?param=local_file:flag.txt with follwing cookies action=scan and signature={result_of_step_1}


#### Read the content of ./result.txt

I struggled for a while to find a way to sign a 'read' action. In my mind we could only execute one action by request: either 'read' or 'scan' . But I finally noticed that we could execute both in a single request. In fact: 
- exec() contained neither a 'switch... case..' nor an 'if... else if .. ' but two simple 'if' one after the other
- It checked if 'action' contained 'scan' (respectively contains 'read') => action could be something like 'scanread' 


From /geneSign analysis we found that the signature was based on a parameter we could control: 
- md5 signature was build from the following: secert_key + param + action
As the action was forced to 'scan' we could bypass this restriction by putting 'read' at the end of 'param field'

=> secert_key + 'hackread' + 'scan'
=> secert_key + hackreadscan'

From here signing :
    action=scan
    param=hackread
or: 
    action=readscan
    param=hack

provided the exact same hash signature. We could sign a read request this way. To bypass the signature protection we just had to ask /geneSign to sign the first one and call /De1ta using the second one. 

1. Let's sign our request: GET  /geneSign?param=hackread
    => I put 'hack' here just to have something in 'param' field later. But I suppose that it would have worked without it 
2. Call url to read the flag: /De1ta?param=hack with following cookies action=readscan and signature={result_of_step_1}
    => Notice that 'read' is no more at the end of 'param' field but at the start of the action 


=> The flag was in the REST call response: {"code": 200, "data": "de1ctf{27782fcffbb7d00309a93bc49b74ca26}"}
